# Omni-directional Robotic Vehicle

**B.Tech Project - KEE 851 | REC Bijnor**


## 📌 Project Overview

The objective of this project was to design and construct an **Arduino-based omni-directional robot** capable of 360° holonomic motion. Unlike standard wheeled robots, this system can move in any direction (X-Y translation) and rotate on the spot simultaneously, making it highly maneuverable for constrained environments. 

**Guide:** Prof. Anuj Kumar, Electrical Engineering Dept., REC Bijnor 

**Timeline:** January 2023 – April 2023 


## 🚀 Key Technical Contributions

**Hardware Integration:** Built the chassis using **4 omni-wheels** and **12V DC gear motors** to achieve full holonomic movement. 

**Control System:** Utilized an **Arduino UNO** as the primary controller, integrated with an **L293D motor driver shield** for independent control of the four motors. 

**Wireless Communication:** Integrated an **HC-05 Bluetooth module** to enable remote operation and multi-directional motion control via a smartphone or custom interface. 

**Algorithmic Implementation:** Developed and implemented control algorithms in the **Arduino IDE** to synchronize wheel speeds, allowing for precise X-Y translation and on-spot rotation.
