# Loss Minimization Control of an Induction Motor Drive

Course Project - EN 659 | Energy Efficient Industrial Drives

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focused on the development and evaluation of control strategies aimed at minimizing losses in Induction Motor (IM) drives. The study compared advanced **Loss Minimization Control (LMC)** against standard constant V/f control across various torque-speed operating points.

* **Instructor:** Prof. V.S.S. Pavan Kumar Hari, DESE, IIT Bombay 

**Timeline:** January 2025 – April 2025 


## 🚀 Key Technical Contributions

**Efficiency Optimization:** Analyzed and implemented control strategies that achieved up to a **7.46% improvement in efficiency** compared to traditional constant V/f control.

**Adaptive Control:** Evaluated 8-bit microprocessor-based adaptive control methods that eliminate the need for complex motor parameter estimation.

**Performance Benchmarking:** Conducted a comprehensive comparison across **17 torque-speed test points** with a 30 ft.lb load torque to validate the energy savings.

**Control Strategy:** Focused on PRF control strategies for precise loss minimization.

**Testing:** Systematic evaluation of efficiency-speed data across 17 distinct test points.
