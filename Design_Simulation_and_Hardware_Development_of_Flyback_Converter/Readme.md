# Design, Simulation, and Hardware Development of Flyback Converter

Lab Project - EN 327 | EMPES Lab, DESE, IIT Bombay 

## 📌 Project Overview

This project involved the complete design, simulation, and hardware fabrication of a **50 W Flyback DC-DC converter**. The design was specifically optimized for high efficiency and stable operation in **Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM)** to serve as a 5 V, 10 A power supply.

**Timeline:** August 2025 – Present 

**Location:** EMPES Lab, IIT Bombay 


## 🚀 Key Technical Contributions

**Simulation & Validation:** Developed a detailed model in **PLECS** to verify CCM operation and transient performance.

**Magnetics Design:** Designed a high-frequency transformer with a **5:1 turns ratio**, including core selection and winding calculations.

**Component Selection:** Performed rigorous selection of MOSFETs, diodes, and output capacitors to optimize the power density and efficiency of the 50 W supply.

**PCB Engineering:** Developed a compact PCB layout using **Altium Designer** and executed the final hardware implementation.
