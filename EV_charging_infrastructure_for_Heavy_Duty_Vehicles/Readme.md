# EV Charging Infrastructure for Heavy Duty Vehicles

M.Tech Seminar - EN 694 | Energy Science and Engineering, IIT Bombay 


## 📌 Seminar Overview

This seminar provides a comprehensive investigation into the global and Indian perspectives on charging infrastructure for Heavy Duty Electric Vehicles (HDEVs). The research explores fast-charging standards, grid integration challenges, and mitigation strategies using renewable energy and storage.

**Guide:** Prof. Zakir Hussain Rather, DESE, IIT Bombay 

**Timeline:** Aug 2024 – Nov 2024 


## 🚀 Key Research Areas

**Charging Standards:** Conducted an in-depth review of HDEV fast-charging standards ranging from **150 kW to 1 MW**, including **CCS, CHAdeMO**, and the emerging **Megawatt Charging System (MCS)**.

**Grid Impact Analysis:** Investigated the grid integration challenges posed by a 6-pulse rectifier-fed 4 kW EV charger, which exhibited a significant **35% THD** in grid current.

**Mitigation Strategies:** Studied **PV-ES-Charger** (Photovoltaic-Energy Storage) solutions to mitigate grid impact.

**Optimization:** Utilized **VLSM** (Virtual Load Storage Management) and optimized sizing techniques for PV and energy storage systems to enhance grid stability.
